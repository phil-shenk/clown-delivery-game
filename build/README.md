This game is from a [game jam](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/clown-cuisine-9)! That means that our small team made the game in a single weekend as part of an organized event (while subsisting on pizza and fruit snacks).

About clown cuisine:

You are a clown, and your goal is to deliver your pies to all of your customers. You will find them scattered throughout the town of Baltimore - you'll have to explore and find them all. You ride your unicycle by pedaling your legs - "A" for the left leg and "D" for the right leg. You'll need to alternate legs to pedal successfully. You can pan the camera and aim by moving your mouse (use the "escape" key to make the cursor appear or disappear), and you can hold your mouse button to charge your throw. Release the mouse button to let the pie fly!

Usage:
* You can download one of these executables to run the game on your computer.
* Windows users: you'll want the .7z file.
* Mac users: you'll want the .dmg file. You will probably have to persuade the computer that it's not a virus.
* Web: see [website](https://pgh.gumbo.systems/clown-cuisine/), but it doesn't work very well - we'd strongly recommend downloading one of the executables.
* Developers: you can run this game in Godot 4
